He wanted all the power, and none of the responsibility. But he took it on anyway. He found a home here. He had friends here. A city that counted on him. And while he may not have liked it... turns out Kaine is every bit the hero that I am. Wherever he is... I hope my brother has found peace. \u00A7c-\u00A7oPeter Parker"
